# bash-directory-counter
BASH Script to count the number of files and sub-directories in a specified directory for a school assignment

Requirements:

When the script is run, a directory will be used by your tutor at the command line, e.g. ./countdf.sh dirname. 

The directory specified will contain:
o a number of text files that contain data
o a number of text files that do not contain any data
o a number of child directories that themselves contain files and directories
o a number of child directories that are themselves empty

The output of the script to the terminal will appear as follows:

The [dirname] directory contains:

x files that contain data

x files that are empty

x non-empty directories

x empty directories

where [dirname] represents the directory of your tutorâ€™s choosing and x represents the number of files and directories found matching each criterion.

Be sure that the script can be run from any directory it is placed in within your tutor's Linux user directory structure.
